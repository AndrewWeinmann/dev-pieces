# dev-pieces

Reusable dev pieces for projects — Renovate configs, `devcontainer.json` setups, and other starter files to copy or reference across repos.

## 📦 What’s Inside

This repo collects configuration “pieces” you can:

- Copy into new projects to get started quickly
- Reference as shared examples for consistency
- Use as a baseline for common dev setups

### Current categories

- **Dev Containers** → `devcontainer.json` templates for VS Code / GitHub Codespaces

### Planned categories

- **Renovate** → Dependency update rules and presets
- **Other Configs** → Editor settings, linting configs, etc.
